        <h3>Values</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>
            <em>
              All humans and living things are sacred and we should intent to
              treat each with respect for their own sake, to benefit of the most
              as possible, and not ever as a means for a selfish end.
            </em>
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            <em>
              We should strive to be as honest, as kind, as transparent, as
              empathetic, as open-minded yet as evidence-based as possible.
            </em>
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>The result of these values has led me to these beliefs:</p>
        <hr />

        <h4>
          <strong>
            Black Lives (and Brown Lives, and Native Lives, and Asian Lives, and
            Arab Lives, and Jewish Lives) Matter.{' '}
          </strong>{' '}
        </h4>
        <p>
          <br />
          It's not that White lives don't matter; it's that non-white lives are
          the ones being disproportionately affected by legal and economic
          systems deeply ingrained into our society. The United States was
          founded on high ideals that its laws fail miserably at living up to. A
          system ingrained so strongly implemented with racial discrimination
          that{' '}

          <strong>
            White lives have always mattered to our justice system; non-white
            lives have not.
          </strong>{' '}
          That's why these statements and movements are necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          "All Lives Matter" is an empty, virtue-signaling statement that is
          entirely meaningless, and just serves to distract and deflect from the
          racial disparities being brought up. It's never used as the driving
          philosophy behind any movements or policies to better All Lives; it's
          not intended to.
        </p>
        <p>
          What? I'm wrong? Dope! I'll see you at the next All Lives Matter rally
          then!
          <br />
          Lmao. No I won't. Because there aren't any. Because it's not a real
          movement. It's a distraction.

        <h4>Support for LGBTQIA Rights</h4>
        <p>
          The advocacy for LGBTQIA rights extends beyond mere acceptance. It is
          a fight for recognition, equality, and the right to exist without
          fear. This value reflects my belief in the importance of personal
          freedom, love, and the right to express one’s identity without fear of
          reprisal. It’s about ensuring that everyone, regardless of their
          gender identity or sexual orientation, can live authentically and
          openly. Everyone deserves the right to love, live, and identify as
          they see fit.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But it's a mental illness!"
          <br />
          It's not, anyone with a basic understanding of psychology knows that.
          But even if it was, so what? That doesn't mean they don't deserve the
          same rights as everyone else. It also would mean that you're actively
          trying to make life harder for people with a mental illness, which
          still makes you a piece of shit. This isn't the argument you think it
          is.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But what about the children?! They're sexualizing them and that's
          bad!!"
          <br />
          Yeah, you're right, it is bad; it would be if that were true anyways.
          If you really want to protect children, start with the churches, which
          are so prevalent with child sexual abuse that{' '}

        <h4>Housing for the Homeless</h4>
        <p>
          There's more empty houses in America than homeless people. You know
          how to solve the homeless issue? Give them houses; it's not that
          fucking hard.

        <h4>Ending the Drug War</h4>
        <p>
          I can write a whole research article on this one; in fact I have (will
          link to it later). Fuck the drug war, fuck the DEA, fuck ICE, fuck the
          police and everyone else enforcing this this.

          Oh yeah, and to the Sackler family: Justice hasn't gotten you yet, but
          it will.

        <h4>Evolving Past Capitalism</h4>
        <p>
          Let’s be honest, capitalism is wreaking havoc. It’s a system that
          allows a select few to hoard wealth while literally leaving others to
          die. The planet can’t take it, and neither can the majority of us.
          It’s clear we’ve got to evolve past the fantasy that profit-driven
          incentives are best if we want to have a shot at a sustainable and
          fair future. We need to evolve, and fast, towards an economic model
          that values all of us, not just the select few. The harder those
          select few make this evolution for all of us, the more painful it's
          going to be for them.
